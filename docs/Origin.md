## Everything to be continued...

I've always intended to build a website for bhgg, so I take my first attemp before his 20th birthday. Due to time constraints, I only made it possible to finish the local parts and thus it remained unfixed.

But today I happened to have time for fixing my own website, so I decided to build a new one to record our loving blog wwwwww. 

I spend about the whole afternoon debugging it and finally represented it to hbh at night.

But then again I spend the whole evening teaching hbh
how to update it and upload his diaries, and write a notes particularly guiding the exact steps.

Then I ask him to update his diary for today as soon as possible but was refused. I feel abandoned wwwwwwww.

When I am sorting my ccd pictures taken last night, hbh asked me if I can upload those pictures as well. So I add the fifth column as `MEMORY` to record these ccds. But now the column is not working well, since the column title can't pop out until I tick title "BLOG". wwww I have to say that a programmer is always on the way debugging.
